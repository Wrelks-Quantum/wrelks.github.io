<p class="info">Flash Cards will work best on Tablet, Laptop, and Desktops computers! They will still function on Mobile Phones just be aware some questions might have cut off text. We are working on improving stability on mobile phones :)</p>

>> The study page is here to provide you with a plentiful set of flash cards for you to study quantum computing from. Ranging from linear algebra to quantum algorithms. These flash cards are actively updated, but if you have any suggestions for sample questions, contact me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Wrelks).
