                        <p>The first paper on quantum theory is published by the German physicist Max Planck. The publication was based around a study of a "blackbody substance". The main take-away from Mr. Planck's study was that energy, given the right environment, can exhibit physical properties. From here until the 1960s there was no mention of quantum computing. Only quantum mechanics and theories and studies of quantum but no mention of it being applied to computing.</p>

                        <p>In the late 60s Stephen Wiesner created a cryptographic tool, Conjugate Coding, that utilized quantum mechanics. This is regarded as the first time quantum and computing had ever been brought together in the same scenario, hence the creation of quantum computing. The abstract idea is that you send out multiple messages in a way that when one is read, it destroys the others. The design used photons polarized in the conjugate bases as it's qubits to pass information.</p>

This is the first sign of a quantum computing advantage. Here is a system that cannot be simulated on a classical computer.</p>

                        <ul><b>1) </b>Paul Benioff outlines for the first time what a quantum mechanical computer would look like. He described how such a computer would operate under the laws of quantum mechanics. He demonstrated this by applying SchrÃ¶dinger's equation to turning machines. The paper was published for public access in April of 1980</ul><br>
                       <ul><b>2) </b>Yuri Manin motivates the idea for quantum computing by publishing his book in the 80s titled, "Computable and Uncomputable".</ul><br>
                         <ul><b>3) </b>Tommaso Toffoli introduces the Toffoli gate for the first time. The Toffoli gate is a controlled controlled not gate, meaning that it has two control bits and one target bit. The gate is referred to as the ccx gate in qiskit.</ul>

                        <p>Fredkin Gate is proposed for the firs time. The gate was essentially a controlled swap gate. The gate has three inputs and three outputs, the outputs transmit the first bit unchanged and swaps the last two bits only if the first bit is 1.

They claimed that no classical algorithm could solve the same problem as effectively, and so this marks most likely the earliest example of a quantum advantage over classical computers. <i>If you aren't aware of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm yet, please check out this <a href="https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/deutsch-jozsa-algorithm">resource.</a></i>

                        <p>During this period a major breakthrough would be made which allowed for researchers to extend the time of a qubit to decay by 1000 times. This meant qubits could be used for a much longer duration of time before they decayed beyond the point of usability. This was first reported by Nicole Casal Moore.</p>
