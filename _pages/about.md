Hello! My name is Perry and I am a high school senior and quantum computing enthusiast. Iâ€™ve been learning about quantum computing for the past two years. During my research, I realized that there are a lot of unrecognized resources; many of which are hard to find online. So I created this simple to navigate website for others to enjoy that will assist with finding interesting data highlighting this subject. Information about communities, playlists, YouTube channels, websites, articles, research papers, podcasts, discord servers, and a whole lot more can be found here. Additionally, you can find content regarding PCB design, Minecraft Plugins, FPGAs, and cryptography. 

In the future, I plan to also share some of my microcontroller projects including mini-game consoles, and various weather readers, and web based devices on ESP32 and ESP8266s. Currently you can find some of my FPGA programs [here.](https://www.relks.org)
