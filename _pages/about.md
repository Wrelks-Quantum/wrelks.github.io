# Bio

Hello! My name is Perry, High School junior, North Carolina Citizen, Quantum Computing Enthusiast, and someone who loves AVR. I've been on and off learning about quantum computing for the past two years or so, and I've never really gotten seriously invested into it, until recently. On my journey to learn more about quantum computing I've realized that there are a lot of unrecognized resources for learning about it, many of which are hard to find. I stumbled across many posts across different forums all asking the same question, "what are some good resources to learn about quantum computing?" And I thought about how much easier it would be to have just one giant easy to use catalog of everything related to quantum computing. Some variants of this exist out there, but in my opinion they are too messy and unappealing and drive away newcomers. So I created a simple to navigate and beginner friendly catalog/archive which highlights literally everything related to quantum computing. Ranging from communities, playlists, YouTube channels, other websites, articles, research papers, podcasts, discord servers, and a whole lot more! And that, is wrelks.com, a one stop shop for your every quantum need.

I also hope to upload content based on some of the AVR projects that I involve myself in. Whether that be mini-game consoles, weather readers, voltage dividers, and anything to do with Atmega chips. If you are at all interested in any of those things, you in the right place!

# Plans

Over time I plan to update this website's tutorials and resources pages as so nothing goes out of date. Quantum computing and AVR is an ever growing subject with more and more content coming out each day.
