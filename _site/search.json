The current encryption standard for most government and private sector IT security purposes is called the Advanced Encryption System.  AES was chosen as the U.S. government security standard in 2001, and eventually also evolved into the encryption standard for most private sector enterprises.AES uses a symmetric algorithm, which means the same key is applied for both encryption and decryption. The algorithm provides 128-bit block encryption and has been designed to supports key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. AES 256-bit encryption is the strongest and most robust encryption standard that is commercially available today.  idera.com",

      "content"  : "What is Qubit by Qubit?Qubit by Qubit is a small yet fast growing organization with the goal of teaching and spreading the importance of quantum computing to the world. The course is designed for high schoolers, university students, and even those in the work force. It’s for everybody!The course at the moment is being funded by IBM and by Google. IBM has long since been pioneering the educational quantum computing landscape. You may’ve heard of their previous quantum computing educational programs such as the IBM quantum experience, Qiskit framework, and the Qiskit summer school that took place in the summer of 2020.Game ChangerQubit by Qubit isn’t like IBM’s previous attempts at teaching quantum computing to the world, this time around, it’s much much more ambitious and exciting.The course is a year long for starters, making it much longer than the prior Qiskit summer school program, and unlike the summer school, this new course actually can count for high school credit. And as a high school student, I couldn’t be more excited to hear this. So for this point alone, this course is already looking pretty good.It’s also worthwhile to take a deep dive into just how diverse this new program is! Over 110 countries are being represented, all 50 states within the USA are being represented, 53% of the course is female, and 40% of the students are students of color! Wow, those are some impressive numbers to be boasting. Another point for you Qubit by Qubit. If you would like to look at more impressive numbers, check out their official website.On top of everything mentioned, the course is even being lead by MIT and Oxford researchers respectively.How is the course really?While yes, everything mentioned above is true, and insanely impressive, it doesn’t really reflect how the course truly is in the eyes of a student. So, lets get into that.Layout of the CourseThe course is mainly organized via the usage of the major talk and text platform discord. This is where the staff will update you on course announcements, and give you the chance to converse with other students.When it’s time to tune in on a lecture, which happens every Sunday, the staff will notify you through the discord, and you will receive an email to remind you that there’s a lecture for that day.Their discord server also features a tagging system for HStudents (High School Students), and Uni/Work-student (In university or workforce). This is done to sort of divide the two groups. Don’t get it confused though! You will have the opportunity to talk with those not under the same tagging but, you can only do this in certain select text channels.Student IdeasAt the beginning of the course all of the students had the opportunity to suggest and create their own text-channels that they believed would benefit the class. Example, in the course there is a text channel named #pc-builders this where those interested in computer building and other topics along the same line can come together and conjugate their ideas with like minded individuals. Yours truly came up with the #helpful-links channel, which is still in play in the student community today!Student Made Text-ChannelsIt’s also important to keep in mind that the student made text channels made by high school students, can only be accessed by fellow high school students. And likewise the other way around for Uni/Work-students. All though I can understand why this may’ve been done. I would love to have seen the opportunity for students to suggest and unlock these channels for both groups of students, as some of these channels are harmless. Like for example #creative-endeavors, which is a channel utilized mainly for sharing each other’s hobby projects. I Don’t see too much reason to lock this channel down exclusively to one or the other set of students.Lecture DesignAs mentioned earlier the lectures occur every Sunday at 2:00PM EST, which for me personally is a pretty good time, I can’t speak for those across the globe however as this time may not work in there favor. I would also like to compliment the team on taking the initiative of recording each lecture so  in the case the timing doesn’t work for a student, they always have the option to watch the lecture at a later date.Below you can see the E-mail that all students receive as lecture reminders;Lecture Reminder Email  NOTE: Attending or even watching the lectures is not required to pass the class, they are simply there to help you understand the material          All though, I recommend you try and watch the lectures as they are super helpful      Overall I would give the lectures an 8/10, they are well made and thought out. The only thing that I could think to improve upon would be to get different proctors. Don’t get me wrong, this semesters proctor was great, but seeing some variety would’ve been nice. I would also like to throw out there a big thank you for the staff on uploading the lecture slideshow presentation before the lecture begins. That was super helpful.LabsEvery week throughout the course you will have one lab session. Labs are split up into 15 groups. Each group goes on a different day, at a different time. And all of the labs are rated per experience level. For the first semester the labs were divvied up like so:  Beginner  High School  High School Advanced  Uni/Workforce &amp; High School  AdvancedMe personally I went for #4 as that seemed most appropriate for me, and plus, it would give me the opportunity to work along side students not in high school.As per what the labs are like, they are pretty much re-caps of the lecture from the previous week. Same content, but with different examples, and numbers. Here’s the catch though. Attending the labs is REQUIRED. You heard me right, if you miss out on too many lab sessions (the limit is 2), you will be kicked from the course for in-activity.In terms of the labs I would give them a 6/10. They are good review, but that’s about it. Would love to see more interaction with the students or setup some class activities for students to compete or interact with one another, to make the labs seem more like a lab, instead of being another lecture.A great example would be like creating a Kahoot for the lab students, or just adding something more interactive. Besides that, the labs were pretty good, and the instructors did a wonderful job at explaining the material.      NOTE: You sign up for your preferred lab at the beginning of the first semester, and are given a second sign up sheet for labs once the second semester starts.        NOTE #2: As with the lectures, you will also receive an email reminding you when your lab is about start.  Homework and MoreThe homework for this course was hosted on the online platform, instructure, which is a learning management platform commonly utilized by online schooling. The way that this platform was utilized, was that every week after we had our lecture on Sunday, the homework would be posted here on instructure, and would be due by next Sunday, 11:59PM. After which, the assignment would be late. You can still turn in your homework after it’s due, but you won’t be counted for full credit for that assignment.The platform also allows for students to retake their homework assignments as many times as they want, whenever they want, throughout the week. On top of this, each homework attempt is given an unlimited time frame to be completed. This is a wonderful feature, I have to give a huge thanks to QxQ for this setup, it provides an educational, yet stress-free environment to practice our knowledge and put it through the ranks! It’s also important to know that homework is auto-graded. The the very minute you turn in your assignment, you are immediately given back your grade, which is given as a percentage, and a fraction for your total correctly answered. The site will also tell you which problems you got incorrect, however, it will not tell you which answer is correct.Questions on the homework come in all different forms, some in multiple choice, and some in text format. When the question is in text format, you will need to provide your answer just as you had gotten in your calculation (the instructions will tell you how to round and format your answer correctly)Within the instructure platform, they also provide their recorded lectures for that week, and upload their own custom made cheat sheets for certain material. For example, there are cheat sheets for Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues that can assist students who are struggling or just need it as a referral for said content.  TLDR instructure is where you will find your homework, review problems, cheat sheets, lecture slide shows, lab recordings, Piazza FAQ, and lecture recordings.          Piazza is a question asking platform that QxQ uses to answer questions by students, more less of a talk and text platform than that of discord.      Instructure Layout ExampleOverall I give the homework and assignments layout a 9/10, I really love the way that everything is formatted and well organized via the instructure platform. This was definitely the go to call in terms of how homework should be posted. My only critique is that there should’ve been a go to place for questions on the discord instead of having a dedicated platform, Piazza, that users need to locate them selves on to have their questions answered. Or at least had given the students the ability to vote on whether the proctor questions to be on the discord or on a separate platform. Other than that, this part of the course was excellent.The contentThe course was advertised as a course for everybody, to the most experienced, and the newcomers. Did it live up to that? Well… Sort of.The course definitely started off pretty seamless with both high school students and Uni/Workforce students staying up to pace. It wasn’t until around week 3 / week 4 when the content started to get pretty rough for newcomers. You were definitely at an advantage if you were either more experienced with quantum computing or simply a Uni/Workforce student. That being said, it obviously wasn’t impossible for high school students to keep up, many did. But an argument can easily be made that if you are a beginner high school student wanting to get into Quantum Computing, get ready to put in more effort in studying than other students. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing.OverallIn conclusion, the first semester of this course was great! And I can’t wait for more. And if you have the time to attend this course in the future, do so! It will be worth your while, and the knowledge you take away will be incredibly useful to the future of quantum computing. There may be some downsides and some flukes to work out, but I don’t doubt those will be ironed over in time.Good work QxQ &amp; thank you to the sponsors for making this class possible!",

      "content"  : "PowaaaaIf you’d happen to take a browse over at the new Ryzen 5000s series CPUs you’ll quickly know that these things are powerhouses! Rendering machines, and gaming monsters. And all of this with the same 105 watt TDP of the previous Ryzen 3000s series. But all good things can’t be simple can they. Myself, along with many others have experienced thermal issues with the 5000s series, specifically the 5900x.x570-E GamingNow I know that while many of us had this thermal issue, many did not. Chances are, that if you are on any other motherboard besides the x570-E Gaming you may’ve not experienced this issue. The issue stems from a collection of strange auto enabled features in the BIOS, and an un-optimized BIOS to begin with.How I found outI found out that I had obvious thermal issues right after installing my new 5900x. Right after I installed the CPU and booted up my computer into the BIOS, * VROOOM *, my computer fans begin going absolutely mad. Which right after booting up a PC, isn’t necessarily abnormal. However, this blaring noise continued on and on for minutes.And then that’s when I see it, the problem. I go over to read my thermals from the BIOS menu, and to my astonishment, it is saying that my CPU is running at ~75-80°C. This is at IDLE in the BIOS menu! Now for a stock cooler, and a cruddy thermal paste job, a temperature reading like this may not be too hard to see. But for what my setup is rocking for it’s cooling solution, Kraken x72 AIO, 6x NF-F12 Noctua fans, and thermal grizzly kryonaut thermal grease, this is unacceptable.Now it’s time to get down to debugging.Re-applying Thermal PasteMy first thought was that my thermal paste application must’ve been bad. So I grabbed my bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol, and a microfiber cloth. Cleaned off the old thermal paste from the copper heat plate on the Kraken X72, and from the CPU. Afterwards I made sure to do a much better job of applying my thermal paste.Thermal Paste Re-applicationAll thought this helped out my situation, but it didn’t solve it. My idle temperatures were still ~70-75°C in BIOS menu, and at windows desktop. So something was still obviously wrong.Always Update . . .My next step of action was to go through my computer and make sure everything was updated. And that’s when it hit me! My BIOS was in version 2802.So I rushed to the BIOS download page for the X570-E Gaming. And downloaded version 3001 into my nearest 8 gig flashdrive. Updated my motherboard, and there it was! My BIOS screen idle was ~60-65°C. All though not the temperatures you should be getting with my kind of setup, it was a step closer.BIOS Updating TutorialBIOS SettingsFrom here I knew it was time to go through my BIOS to begin looking for possible settings that could have a major affect on my CPUs thermals. When doing my digging I found two very interesting options  Precision Boost Overdrive  Core Performance BoostUpon disabling these two options, my computer goes dead-silent. Why? My CPU is now running ~45°C IDLE! Both in the BIOS menu, and in the Windows desktop.And when playing games like Warzone I didn’t even go above the 62°C mark!TLDR - FIX  Update your BIOS on the X570-E Gaming to version 3001 or higher  Disable Precision Boost Overdrive  Disable Core Performance BoostRemember to share this content if it helped you out! And comment your questions and concerns if you have any!",

Battery packs are fun things that can be built at home with relative ease and without burning a hole in your wallet. If you have decent circuit/PCB design and manufacturing knowledge you can easily design your own battery pack at home.Fast Charging?For those maybe a little confused on the term ‘fast charging’, it pretty much means charging that utilizes a much higher wattage then normal USB charging solutions. For example a battery pack that can charge a phone at 15 watts would be considered a fast charging capable battery pack. Whereas the normal charging rate is usually around 5 watts.What the Board DoesTo be clear this board is NOT the entire battery pack logic. It’s actually a separate print of the logic which takes in a high amperage 5V USB input and lowers it down to 4.2V at around the same amperage of the initial input. So this would be the initial set of logic that the USB power would go through then after it’s been shifted down, out to the LiPo it goes.analog.com has a wonderful in-depth tutorial discussing how voltage step down circuitry works. Check it out!Why 4.2 Volts?The battery pack that I have been designing utilizes a 3.7V LiPo battery. LiPo batteries are the same batteries that you’ll find in many of modern day handheld electronics, laptops, phones, tablets, and many more. But wait, 4.2V? Isn’t the battery rated at 3.7V? Well the 3.7V simply stands for the voltage input that the LiPo battery is capable of, and the voltage the battery will remain at for a large majority of it’s lifespan. The battery it’s self can be charged with a voltage range of 3.7V - 4.2V.How it comes togetherStep 1 | Picking the partsOne of the most difficult parts of designing circuitry is picking out the ICs (Integrated Chips) that you want to use. Many things have to come into consideration. Package of the IC, can it be manufactured onto a PCB, what temperature range can it operate at, what the maximum/minimum amperage/voltage, does it have any charging safeguards, is it configured out of the box or does it have to configured to a certain amperage rating with external capacitors and resistors. These are all of the things that come to mind when picking out a chip to fit your design. Thankfully charging solutions are a very popular market and thus there are many different charging ICs to choose from. So where do I find these ICs to pick from? I personally use either Mouser or DigiKey to search for ICs to use in my builds. When you find the IC that sounds appealing based off it’s highlighted specs you can then read the datasheet of said IC to learn more about the chip to see if will fit your application. I personally looked for a IC that was rated for charging LiPo batteries, could output anywhere from 3.7V - 4.2V, and could handle high amperage. The chip that I settled on could do just that what I’ve mentioned but with a catch. A single chip couldn’t handle extremely high amperage, they would need to be a put in a series. This is why you see 4 of the same looking IC on the board.TIP: 99% of IC datasheets will come with schematic examples to give you an idea for how to use the chip in practice.Step 2 | Picking a ManufacturerThe main goal when looking for a manufacturer is to find one that’s cheap, fast, and is good for the quantity of product you are wanting. What I mean by the last statement is that there are some manufacturers that are better for low quantity shipments and others for high quantity. I personally was looking into ordering 10 boards so I went with a pretty well known PCB manufacturer known for low quantity orders, JLPCB. In about 5 days my boards were here! The other big aspect I look out for when looking into PCB manufacturers is seeing whether they support automatic placing of the ICs themselves or if it’s exclusively PCB stencil manufacturing. Many manufacturers print the actual board stencil but without the chips soldered on. Thankfully JLPCB supports pre-soldered ICs for a little extra cost.Part 3 | TestingNow that everything has arrived it was time to put it all to test. For the test I will be inputting a 5V 2Amp input and expecting a 4.2v ~2Amp output. Before I get into this test I believe a little tour on the surface of the board is in order for some context.Final Product      On the left side you’ll find the USB input, and their corresponding polarization can be found by the plus and minus above the copper hole.        In the middle is the battery output terminal, here is where the stepped down 4.2 volts result will come from.        On the right side you’ll find the ‘status’ terminal. The IC that I chose has two different signifier flags built into it. One being chrg which when LOW means that the battery is currently charging. The other status flag is the stby, this flag when LOW means that the battery is completely charged.  So after some thorough testing, it appears that the circuit Works! It was successfully able to charge up a 3.7V 5,000mah LiPo battery! I hope this little write up was either useful / fun to read and I hope to release more of these in the coming future! See you then.",

      "content"  : "What is it?Superdense Coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows for a sender to send two classical bits of information to another user by utilizing only one qubit. This algorithm takes advantage of something called a ‘bell circuit’. A bell circuit is a combination of a Hadamard gate going into the control bit of the controlled not gate; see image belowBell CircuitA two qubit bell circuit will have an equal probability of getting either 00 or 11 as results. (Assuming the computer is noiseless.)How it worksIn the superdense coding algorithm we have three different users.      User 1User 2User 3    The first user shares the two outputs of a two qubit bell state with the receiver and the sender.The second user who is the sender, encodes the qubits The final user receives those qubits and decodes them  With those rules in consideration, your final design will look like this;Superdense Coding Diagram - creditA good thing to try and think about is how a bell state truly works. Think about it, the control bit is entangled with the not gate. So when we set the control bit into a super position it also changes the target bit to a superposition as well, because they are entangled.We can denote the bell state mathematically like so\[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)\]The EncoderThe encoders job is simple, take the first qubit from the bell state and apply a single gate operation to it. In the two qubit example of this algorithm there are four different ways for the encoder to encode their qubit. Either with a Identity gate (does no change), X-gate, Z-gate, or a combination of the Z and X-gate. Each of these four different combinations represents an intended message.      MessageApplied GateResulting State    $$00$$$$I$$$$|00\rangle + |11\rangle$$    $$10$$$$X$$$$|01\rangle + |10\rangle$$    $$01$$$$Z$$$$|00\rangle - |11\rangle$$    $$11$$$$ZX$$$$-|01\rangle + |10\rangle$$  So if I the sender wanted to pass on the message of 10 to my receiver, I would apply an X-gate.The ReceiverThe receivers job is bit easier. All they have to do is take the untouched second qubit from the initial bell state and the new encoded qubit from the sender and pass it through a ‘reverse’ bell circuit.the result will end up being what ever the sender has set their gate to. So in our example if the sender applied an X gate the receiver would decode the message and receive 10 as a result.QiskitNow that we have a foundation for what the superdense coding algorithm is, we can test it on a quantum computer simulator using Qiskit!If you do not have Qiskit installed yet, check out their official tutorial here.Importsfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer, IBMQfrom qiskit.visualization import plot_histogramCircuit#Create a quantum circuit with two qubits .qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)#create a hadamard gate on qubit zero (the first qubit)qc.h(0)#create a controlled not gate with the target bit on qubit 1 (second qubit), and the control bit on qubit 0 (first qubit)qc.cx(0,1)#Barriers are for separating the gates from one another to neaten things.qc.barrier()#create a not gate on qubit zeroqc.x(0)qc.barrier()qc.cx(0,1)qc.h(0)#Create a loop to measure all of the qubits in the circuitfor i in range(2):    qc.measure(i, i)Printing Results#For this example we are setting the backend to a simulator so in this case, no quantum noise will come out in the final result. sim_backend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')job = execute(qc, sim_backend, shots=1024)result = job.result()print('Simulator: ')counts = result.get_counts(qc) #just setting a varprint(counts)plot_histogram(counts)Printing the circuit#This line will print out the circuit in MPL form, which is a much cleaner alternative to printing it out in ASCII#If you wish to print the circuit in ASCII form, write the following 'print(qc)'qc.draw(output="mpl")If you did everything correctly your output should look like the following;Superdense Coding Circuit Output  The far left side of the circuit is your bell-state preparation  The middle half with the ‘X’ gate is the Encoder  And the to the far right you have your reverse bell-state, which is the receiver.
