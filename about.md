## Bio

Hello! My name is Perry, now a junior, and quantum computing enthusiast. I've been on and off learning about quantum computing for the past two years or so, and I've never really gotten seriously invested into it, until recently. On my journey to learn more about quantum computing I've realized that there are a lot of unrecognized resources for learning about it, many of which are hard to find. I stumbled across many posts across different forums all asking the same question, "what are some good resources to learn about quantum computing?" And I thought about how much easier it would be to have just one giant easy to use catalog of everything related to quantum computing. Some variants of this exist out there, but in my opinion they are too messy and unappealing and drive away newcomers. So I created a simple to navigate and beginner friendly catalog/archive which highlights literally everything related to quantum computing. Ranging from communities, playlists, YouTube channels, other websites, articles, research papers, podcasts, discord servers, and a whole lot more! And that, is wrelks.com, a one stop shop for your every quantum need.

## Updates

Over time I plan to update this website's tutorials and resources pages so nothing goes out of date, as quantum computing is an ever growing subject with more and more content coming out each day.

    <p>I noticed there wasn't a 'one stop shop' for everything quantum computing related so I created wrelks.com to fix that. The site will gradually grow over time, slowly, but surely.</p>
