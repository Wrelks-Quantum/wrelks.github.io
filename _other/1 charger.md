## About

If you are not already familiar, my second favorite activity along side quantum computing is embedded systems/circuit design. It's something I've always been very passionate about. I felt as if Wrelks would be a fun place to not only serve as an archive for quantum computing resources and tutorials but also be a place to host some of my personal side projects. Anyways, hope you enjoy, overtime I will add more and more of my personal projects here for you to browse :)
