### Welcome to Wrelks.com, happy to see you here!

First things first is the home screen. You are greated with two diffrent categories, each with their own each sub catergories which correspond to their own pages. 

The general tab is where you can find things that aren't necessarily related to quantum computing such as news and updates about the site and other miscellaneous type content such as this page here!

The qiskit tab is of course where you'll find all of the content related to qiskit, everything from how to install qiskit to how to program your own circuit, all the way up running algorithms with qiskit.
