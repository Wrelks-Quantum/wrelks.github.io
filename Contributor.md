## What does it mean to be a Wrelks.com contributor?

As you may know, Wrelks.com is an ever evolving site that has new content and updates coming out on a weekly basis to keep the site and it's materials fresh and new. Doing this isn't easy, it takes many hours and days worth of work and development to keep this up. That's why I am looking for a contributor, someone to help in development and growth in the site.
