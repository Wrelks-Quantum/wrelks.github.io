Need to make Minecraft more challenging? Well No Sprint is for you. This plugin makes it so

# Fast Mobs

Another plugin to further test your skill. Fast Mobs adds a various number of new changes, similarly to what you could expect in
that of a Dream/GeorgeNotFound/Sapnap challenge video.

* All mobs are given speed multipliers, making every mob faster then the player
* All mobs are given damage buffs
* Zombies have a **100%** chance to spawn with an Iron Chestplate and Iron Sword
* Zombies have a **100%** chance to drop their Iron Chestplate upon death
* Creeper Explosions are slightly buffed
* Creepers have a random chance to drop between 1 and 4 TNT upon death
